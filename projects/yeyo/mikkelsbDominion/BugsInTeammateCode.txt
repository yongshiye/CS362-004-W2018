#######1.adventurerCardEffect
int adventurerCardEffect(int* drawntreasure, struct gameState* state, int* currentPlayer, int* temphand, int* z, int* cardDrawn) 

In the method above parameter drawntreasure defined is *drawntreasure.

But when using drawntreasure in the while loop, it is using drawntreasure withouth ‘*’. It is causing my card test failed.
while(drawntreasure<2){}, 


#######2.smithyCardEffect
In the orginal code, smithy card will draw 3 cards.
case smithy:
      for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	{
	  drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
	}

But in his smithyCardEffect method, for loop is checking i<=3 which will draw 4 cards.
for (i = 0; i <= 3; i++)

#######3.mineCardEffect
int mineCardEffect(struct gameState* state, int* currentPlayer, int* choice1, int* choice2, int* handPos, int* j) { 

In the method above parameter j defined is a pointer *j.

But when using j in a if state, it is using j withouth ‘*’. It is causing runtime failure.
if (state->hand[*currentPlayer][i] == j)
